# VIVE Registry Tool

VIVE Registry Tool lets your project access packages from VIVE by editing the `Packages/manifest.json` in your project, adding VIVE registry as a [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

After VIVE registry has been added, you can install packages from VIVE in Unity package manager, including:

- VIVE Input Utility
- Wave XR Plugin
